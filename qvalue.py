  NOTE: Other python versions of this available on the web do not properly
  estimate pi0 because it uses splrep with s=0 (no smoothing). The pi0 estimate
  from these functions is simply the last pi0 value considered and the spline
  fitting does nothing. e.g.
  https://github.com/nfusi/qvalue
  https://gist.github.com/ryananeff/0232597b04ec1e5947de2ad8b9292d6e
  
  Here, instead of splines, we are calculating the standard deviations of the pi0s
  > lambda. Since the pi0s tend to flatten out as lambda approaches 1 the
  standard deviation tends to be at a minimum at the lambda where the
  pi0s converge to the null proportion. The pi0 is taken as the mean of the pi0s
  > lambda where the standard deviation is at a minimum. See
  https://dxcalc.com/pub/pi0_estimate.png for a graphical illustration.

  It is probably a good idea to call this with plot=True on your p-values at
  least once, to see what the distribution looks like. If for some reason it
  seems off you can try providing your own pi0 with the pi0=my_pi0 option. A higher pi0
  will give more conservative q-value estimates.
